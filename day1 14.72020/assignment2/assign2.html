    <p> Question 2 ans </p>

        <p> Q2) difference between var let and const in javascript with example </p>

    <p> <h1> The Differences Between let and var </h1>
        var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.<br>
        It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
        A var variable can be redeclared and updated. <br>
        A let variable be be updated but not redeclared.</p>
        <p>
            An example of trying to redeclare a let variable:<br>
            // In editor:<br>
            &lt;script<br>
             let points = 10;<br>
             let points = 20;<br>
             /script&gt;<br>
             // In the console I get an error:<br>
             Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'points' has already been declared
        </p>
        <p>how can i update it<br>
            let points = 10;<br>
            points = 20;<br>
            // In console:<br>
            points<br>
            // Returns:<br>
            20</p>
            <P > <h2>let and var can be reassigned to a new value while const cannot be reassigned.</h2></P>
            <p> var a = 30;<br>
                a = 40;<br>
                //output: 40<br>
                console.log(a);<br>
                <br>
                let b = 'hello';<br>
                b = 'world';<br>
                //output: 'world'<br>
                console.log(b);<br>
                <br>
                const c = 'hello'<br>
                //Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.<br>
                c = 'world'  </p>

                <p>
                    
                    *Scope<br>
                    var is function-scoped.<br>
                    let and const are block-scoped(any code within {} braces).<br>
                    Here is an article on Understanding Scope in Javascript.<br>
                    *Hoisting<br>
                    var is always hoisted to the top of their respective scope.<br>
                    let and const is also hoisted but will throw an error if the variable is used before the declaration. It is a little complicated and we will discuss it in a separate article dedicated to this specific topic.
